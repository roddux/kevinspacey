create / adapt a kernel module that allows user-space access to DMA memory
use for fuzzing

ref: chipsec, linux drivers, etc

read how the linux ata-piix libata drivers etc handle DMA access

the goal is to be able to re-create reading a file by using custom tooling, so we
can then throw spanners in the works here and there.

alternate short-term goal:
- adapt the existing drivers and throw random if(RANDOM) byte flips in 
- write a program to make a load of FS noise, triggering the above

alternate-alternate goal:
- write a module to *hook* the existing functions
- randomly bitflip, etc
